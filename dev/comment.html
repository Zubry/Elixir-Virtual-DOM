A key feature of the VDOM is that it is immutable by design, which enables functional-style programming in the browser, server, or any environment where it is necessary to interact with the DOM. This is accomplished by rendering the VDOM from the top down, so that a call to render({x, y}) always yields the same tree structure. In order to make changes to the VDOM, for example if the programmer wants to render the view with y+1 instead of y, a call must be made to render({x, y + 1}), and then the two trees must be diffed and then patched together using standard DOM operations.</comment-body><comment-footer  style="display: block;"><a href="/comments/8e8fbz/" style="color: #3366CC; font-size: .8em; text-decoration: none;">Permalink</a><a href="/save/8e8fbz/" style="color: #3366CC; font-size: .8em; text-decoration: none;"> Save</a><a href="/reply/8e8fbz/" style="color: #3366CC; font-size: .8em; text-decoration: none;"> Reply</a></comment-footer></comment>
